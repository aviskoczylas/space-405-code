This document will explain how the code works and what it is doing, step by step.

First, we must import the numpy, h5py, and matplotlib libraries in order to manipulate arrays, use h5 data, plot the data, and manipulate images, respectively. 

Next, we open the file for reading by specifying the filepath. 

Then, we convert the h5 file into numpy arrays (see juno_data_processing_documentation for details)
In this data file, list s1[0] is the latitude boundaries, list s1[1] is the longitude boundaries, and list s1[0] is the number of boundary points. 

However, there is a problem we have to deal with first: the file stores the value -999.9 when no actual data was measured, and this will mess up our plots unless we get rid
of these junk values. This is important only if we wish to plot incomplete ellipses with incomplete data.

We work around this by using a data type called a mask, which tells functions to ignore certain parts of an array when operating on them. We will 
define our mask as all latitude and longitude points that are equal to -999.9 (the junk value, and not a valid latitude or longitude).

After we apply the mask, we can proceed with
